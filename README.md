# Glitter-Gitter

Glitter gitter is a simple userscript that allows you to open someone's Free Code Camp profile by clicking their name in chat.


## Getting started

### Install

Requires either [GreaseMonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) (FireFox) or [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) (Chrome, Opera, Safari, MSE).

You can use this [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1W2p6qLBUI) video or Google [installing userscripts](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=installing+userscripts).

Once you have it installed, go to the [chat](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/Help) and you will see ninjas - like the screenshot below!

Red Background Ninja - Uses the name the @.

Non-Red Background Ninja - Uses the name without the @.

Why? Sometimes one won't work, but the other will. There isn't any definite way to tell which one won't land a 301 at this time.
